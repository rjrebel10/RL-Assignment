# Deep RL Assignments

## Introduction
This assignment was completed using Python (v3.6)

## Framework
Open AI's gym package was used to initialize the LunarLander environments.

## Algorithms
I leveraged work from theryanchow and gabrielgarza for the foundation for the algorithm implementations.

## Required Packages / Installation
After installing python, use pip3 to install each of the following packages.
* numpy
* gym
* box2d
* keras
* tensorflow

Example:
```pip3 install numpy```

## Run Code

Run Policy_Gradient to observe the deep-policy-network agent's learning performance.
```python3 Deep_RL_Policy_Gradient.py```

Run DQN to observe the deep-q-network agent's learning performance.
```python3 Deep_RL_DQN.py```
