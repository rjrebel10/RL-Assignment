# RL-Assignment

## Introduction
This assignment was completed using Python (v3.6)

## Framework
Open AI's gym package was used to initialize the FrozenLake environments.

## Algorithms
I leveraged work from Moustafa Alzantot and Arthur Juliani for the foundation for the algorithm implementations.

## Required Packages / Installation
After installing python, use pip3 to install each of the following packages.
* numpy
* matplotlib
* gym

Example:
```pip3 install numpy```

## Run Code

Run value-iteration.py and policy-iteration.py to review the respective algorithm results.
```python3 value-iteration.py```
```python3 policy-iteration.py```

Run q-learning.py and its alpha and gamma variations to analyze the q-learning algorithm.
```python3 q-learning.py```
